# Get Veo3.1 Video Details

> Query the execution status and results of Veo3.1 video generation tasks.

<Info>
  This endpoint is the authoritative source of truth for querying the execution status
  and final results of all Veo 3.1 video tasks, including regular generation,
  video extension, 1080P upgrade, and 4K upgrade tasks.
</Info>

## Supported Task Types

This interface supports querying **all Veo 3.1 task types**, including:

* **Regular Video Generation**\
  Text-to-video, image-to-video, reference/material-based generation
* **Video Extension**\
  Tasks created via the Extend Veo 3.1 Video interface
* **1080P Upgrade Tasks**\
  High-definition upgrade tasks created via Get 1080P Video
* **4K Upgrade Tasks**\
  Ultra-high-definition upgrade tasks created via Get 4K Video

## Status Descriptions

| successFlag | Description                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`         | Generating — task is currently being processed                               |
| `1`         | Success — task completed successfully                                        |
| `2`         | Failed — task failed before completion                                       |
| `3`         | Generation Failed — task created successfully but upstream generation failed |

## Important Notes

* Query task status using `taskId`
* You may poll this endpoint periodically until the task completes
* Callback mechanisms push completion events, but **this endpoint remains the final authority**
* `fallbackFlag` is a **legacy field** and may appear only in older regular generation tasks

### Response Field Descriptions

<ParamField path="fallbackFlag" type="boolean">
  Only exists in regular video generation tasks. Whether generated using fallback model. `true` means backup model was used, `false` means primary model was used. 4K video generation tasks do not include this field.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="successFlag" type="integer">
  Task success status identifier:

  * `0`: Generating
  * `1`: Success
  * `2`: Failed
  * `3`: Generation Failed
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="response" type="object">
  Detailed result information after task completion. For regular video generation tasks, contains video URLs etc.; for 4K video generation tasks, contains 4K video URLs and related media information.
</ParamField>

### Task Type Identification

#### Regular Video Generation Tasks

The `fallbackFlag` field can identify whether the task used a fallback model:

* `true`: Generated using fallback model, video resolution is 720p
* `false`: Generated using primary model, may support 1080P (16:9 aspect ratio)

<Note>
  Videos generated using the fallback model cannot be upgraded to high-definition versions through the Get 1080P Video interface.
</Note>

#### 4K Video Generation Tasks

* Dedicated tasks for generating 4K ultra-high-definition videos
* Does not include `fallbackFlag` field
* Generated videos are in 4K resolution
* Response includes `mediaIds` and related media information
